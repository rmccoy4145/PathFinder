# PathFinder
A path finding algorithm written in Java, created as a case study on recursion.

The algorithm will place a '*' for every point visited. If a path is found the 
matrix will be printed along with the points it took to solve the matrix.

The following matrix is solved for a path from 'S' to 'F'.
